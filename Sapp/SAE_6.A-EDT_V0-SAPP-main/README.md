# Courroux

## Project Overview

Courroux is a web application developed for timetable management, initiated by the pedagogical manager of the Computer Science department at IUT de Montreuil. The aim is to revamp the existing timetable system used at the IUT, as the Java JWT timetable created in 2004 no longer aligns with the evolving needs of various users. This application is designed to be versatile and is extendable for use by other universities. Moreover, its open-source license permits users to modify it freely, and there's an option to utilize only the API and reconstruct the front-end from scratch.
